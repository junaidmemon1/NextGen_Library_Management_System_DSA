# 📚 Library Management System

A dynamic, frontend-only **Library Management System** built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Firebase Authentication**, and pure **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA) — without relying on traditional databases or APIs for book operations.  
Every book action (add, remove, issue, return, search) is powered by a custom **Linked List** implementation. Authentication ensures that access stays secure.
